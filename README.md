# Arduino-Based-Pong-Game
Code for an Arduino based Pong Game using four 8x8 LED matrices, 2 joysticks, and two 7-segment displays. The game is controlled using the x-axis of the joysticks and clicking in the sticks serves the ball (only the player who is scored against is able to serve). The score is displayed on the 7-segment displays.

Requires the LedControl and Binary libraries to control the matrices.
Requires an Arduino Mega or similar board due to the project requiring a rather large number of digital pins.

This branch is devoted to a prototype program to move each paddle up and down the screen.
